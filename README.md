# Gulp-Nodemon
Use gulp's refreshing features while running a server at the same time with node!

## How-to
1. Run `npm install` for all the dependencies.
1. Start up the server with nodemon first using `nodemon`.
1. Then run gulp with `gulp`.

Viola! You can now watch your code appear and change live in your browser while running server-side code with nodemon at the same time!
